The purpose of this project is to increase workplace safety by creating a machine learning model that detects whether a worker is wearing a safety helmet or not.
<br>
This is a final project for Le Wagon Tokyo Data Science & AI batch #1639 and was presented on May 31st 2024 at the Shibuya Google for Startups campus.

The YOLO model was selected for it's excellent object detection capabilities and trained on custom data.
<br>
Specifically YOLO v8n was selected for its fast detection speed.

## Getting Started
In order to perform training, raw data must be reformatted for the YOLO model. See preprocess.py for details.
### Installing Packages (Linux/WSL)
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Running Streamlit App locally (Linux/WSL)
```
streamlit run app/app.py
```
### Running Streamlit App in a Docker Container
```
docker build -t helmet_det_app .
docker run -p 8080:8080 helmet_det_app
```
Once the container is running, you can open the app in your web browser at localhost:8080
## Built With
- [YOLO](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/) - State of the art computer vision model
- [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) - Web app framework
## Acknowledgements
- [Safety-Helmet-Wearing-Dataset](https://github.com/njvisionpower/Safety-Helmet-Wearing-Dataset) for training data

## Next Steps
- Train model on expanded safety helmet data set.
- Potentially usable data #1: [PPE_detection](https://github.com/ZijianWang-ZW/PPE_detection/tree/master)
- Potentially usable data #2: [helmet-detection](https://github.com/wujixiu/helmet-detection)
- Include other safety equipment such as safety vests, gloves, or safety glasses
- Train YOLO v8 m or larger for better accuracy
